abstract = {Using state-of-the-art recurrent neural network architectures, this study attempts to predict credit default swap risk premia for BR[I]CS countries as accurately as possible. In the time series setting, these recurrent neural networks are ELMAN, NARX, GRU, and LSTM RNNs, considering local and global features. The predictive power of each architecture is compared, and the results differ depending on the country. NARX RNN was the best predictor for Brazil and South Africa in various settings. Meanwhile, ELMAN RNN produces more accurate results in China, whereas Russia’s long short-term memory RNN achieves the best predictors among other countries’ RNNs.}

We obtained the primary dataset of 27 NATO member countries between 2009 and 2021 for their military expenditures to accomplish this. The results show no convergence between the military expenditures of NATO member states. In addition, although these 27 member countries are divergent, the analysis also identified three convergent clubs among NATO members with exciting patterns and trends in their military expenditures.}

  abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to reveal the extent of the import dependency on electricity, gas, steam, and air conditioning supply (EGSA), the basic component of energy, in Turkey. Such that growing industrialization in Turkey has expanded the need for energy since many sectors use energy as input to produce output. However, Turkey’s domestic production fails to meet the energy demand. For this reason, Turkey meets approximately 75 percent of its energy needs through imports, leading to an increase in the current account deficit. Energy imports, approximately 20 percent of total imports, have become the primary component of the current account deficit, exposing the Turkish economy to instabilities in global gas and oil prices and several additional risks. In this context, we analyzed the extent of the dependency on energy by the input-output tables of 2002 and 2012. The results underline that as production increases, energy imports increase, and the economic leakage generated by the rise in demand for energy increases. This creates a significant obstacle to the development of the Turkish economy. Hence, existing policies for domestic energy production need to be strengthened for sustainable development goals and to decrease the high current account deficit in Turkey.}

  abstract = {
  Objective
  Citizens use nonelectoral means of political participation along with electoral ones. However, we expect that engaging in nonelectoral political participation (NEPP) is quite dependent on the legitimacy of the state and its institutions, as well as the regime type. This article explores the relationship between NEPP and political trust (PT), which can indicate the legitimacy of such institutions.
  Method
  We utilize the seventh wave of World Values Survey to test such relationships in countries classified as democratic and nondemocratic following the Freedom in the World Index. We hypothesize that in democratic countries there is an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship between PT and NEPP. We also hypothesize that there would be a negative relationship between PT and NEPP in nondemocratic countries.
  Result
  The analysis of the data confirms the first hypothesis, which is our main contribution. We also found that the negative relationship in the second hypothesis exists and is linear.
  Conclusions
  The findings indicate that respondents in each set of countries interpret trust and participation differently. In democracies, citizens engage in NEPP when they have a medium level of trust in political institutions, and in other regimes, citizens take that risk only when their mistrust of the institutions of the regime falls below a certain level.

The OLS and GMM analyses reveal horizontal convergence between semi-periphery and core countries as classified by Chase-Dunn et al. (2000). This classification also explains vertical convergence examined with clustering analysis between these countries.}

  keywords = {Neşet Ertaş, Sentiment Analysis, Sentiment Index, Machine Learning, Deep Learning.},
  abstract = {This article aims to highlight the emotional characteristics of the lyrics and compositions of the folk songs sung by Neşet
  Ertaş. For this purpose, the lyrics of 339 songs and the musical information of 264 compositions were crawled. There is also
  a speech among them. Three different sources have been used to obtain the lyrics and text of speech. Besides, an additional
  process on to them has been applied; finally, verse-based or sentence-based texts have been obtained. In this process, these
  texts have been removed from certain words that do not have a meaning on their own, such as unnecessary punctuations,
  stopwords, onomatopoeic words, question suffixes, and transformed into a plain form. After this stage, verses or sentences
  have been made processable. First of all, to find the Turkish sentiments of each lyric, state-of-the-art machine learning
  techniques have been applied to them, and the sentiment scores of each lyric have been computed. Three different machine
  learning models have been used to calculate sentiment scores. These three different models are re-trained for the Turkish
  sentiments, which are of the models developed by Google. Only a single sentiment score has been obtained for each verse
  or sentence. The average of this sentiment score obtained from three different models has been calculated and used to
  satisfy consistency. Afterward, a sentiment vector consisting of the verse of each song or each sentence of the speech text
  has been created. The average of this sentiment vector is the overall score of that text (song or speech). The variance of this
  sentiment vector has also been calculated, in which this variance has been used to measure the sentiment tides in the song
  or speech text. Later, some valuable variables from a widely used music listening platform have been obtained as a basis
  for composition information. Here, 10 variables named acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness,
  loudness, speechiness, tempo, valence, popularity have been obtained. Three of them, danceability, energy, and valence
  variables have been taken into account to estimate the emotional score of the composition by getting the average of these
  three variables. These scores are going to be matched then with the musical information of compositions of each unique
  song which are 169 intersectional sets of them, and an emotional map has been drawn statistically, which can be modeled
  with the dimension of sentiments of lyrics and sentiments of composition showing Neşet Ertaş's emotional map. In the map
  of emotions, the axes have been set in the range of (-1, +1). Therefore, the scores obtained for both texts and compositions
  have been rescaled in the range of (-1, +1) with a formula generated for this purpose, which makes the scores of both texts
  and compositions are made comparable. After this stage, the sentiments of the texts are placed on the x-axis for the map of
  emotions while composition sentiments are placed on the y-axis. On the x-axis, which is called the lyrics scale, a score of
  -1 is indicated by feelings of "sorrow", and a score of +1 is indicated by feelings of "happy". The composition scale, on the
  other hand, shows -1 score as “melancholic” and +1 score as “cheerful” on the y-axis. According to the results obtained, it
  has been determined that the dominant characteristic of Neşet Ertaş's lyrics is based on sorrow words and that most of his
  folk songs are grouped in sorrowful lyrics and melancholic compositions. In addition, it has been found that his words are
  characterized by emotional changes and emotional tides; it has been also determined thanks to word cloud analysis that he
  often has given humane and moral advice in phrases in the lyrics}
